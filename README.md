Hello, my name is Peter (Pete) Nelson. I write and develop code under the name "Zero Sum Games" and "The Brookmonte Group,"
but both of those entities are really just me. In the past I was a senior systems and software architect and engineer
for a large aerospace company, but now I'm retired, and I write code just for fun and to share. Right now, I'm working
on a Windows desktop application called Realm Studio, which is meant for gamers, writers, world builders, etc. to use for
developing fanstasy maps for their games, novels, fantasy worlds, or whatever they like. The application has similarities to 
Wonderdraft, which is an application I've used, and I think works very well, but has some feature limitations that I hope
the Realm Studio application can improve on. If you're interested, please check it out!

If you'd like to contact me about Realm Studio, send an email to support -at- brookmonte.com.
